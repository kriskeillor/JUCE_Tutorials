Note that the JUCE logger is [recommended as best practice for cross-platform output compatibility](https://forum.juce.com/t/how-does-juce-redirect-stdout/17680/3?u=kriskeillor).

For debugging, use the [dbg macro](https://docs.juce.com/master/group__juce__core-system.html#ga679635952a5d2eb25f3b31398f0fcc25), which is part of the logger.
